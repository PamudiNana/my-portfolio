        <header>“I want to commit suicide"</header>
        <p>I heard a voice through my phone and it took me few seconds to process what I 
            actually heard. It was a friend from school, not the type of person who would 
            call me at 1.00 am and splash out this kind of words. I was speechless and 
            was about to ask whether it was a prank, but when she broke into tears, 
            I felt her pain although I could not see them running down her cheeks. 
            She told me her story. What was her story about? I will relate it to 
            you through my article.</p>

            To give a bit of background information, she is a teenager, was pretty good 
            at studies, had a lot of friends at school and was teachers’ favorite most 
            of the time. But things started changing from one point. One day when we 
            were having a conversation, she told how she was hyped-up about her Instagram 
            account reaching 1K followers. I never took it that serious, but now I realize 
            that it was her changing point.
            How can social media change one’s life? Or simply end a life?

            This term ‘social media’ did not have much gravity back then, but now it has 
            almost become an epidemic due to addiction. But the interesting fact is that 
            the choice of making it a plague or a blessing is in the hands of the user.

        <header> La vie en rose </header>
        <p> Viewing one’s life through social media is like viewing life through a rose 
            tinted glass, reminding us the famous French quote; “La vie en rose”. Usually, 
            people on social media reveal only the side they want others to notice and 
            admire. But unfortunately there is a crowd that gets deceived by this faux-play. 
            Social media is like a game of scrolling over detesting content and sticking 
            to desirable content. In reality, life is not always ‘rose’, there are blues, 
            blacks and greys among the pinks. When our eyes get too much used to the color 
            ‘rose’, they become over sensitive to get exposed to the dark hues of reality.
             We forget how to face the downsides of life. Nevertheless, if social 
             media can be used with a balanced perspective, it is a good place to watch,
             learn and grow.

        <header>Dopamine outburst</header>
        <p>
            Addictions usually root on this famous hormone called Dopamine. “… neuroscientists 
            have compared social media interaction to a syringe of dopamine being injected 
            straight into the system.” (Hiliard, 2019) Minds of social media addicts get used 
            to instant rewards which do not seek much effort. They expect real life passions 
            and dreams to come true just as easily as how they get likes and positive comments 
            to their selfies. They end up getting depressed over slightest obstacles.

        <p>But at the same time if these social networks can be used cleverly, it is a good place to display our talents and interests that can have a positive impact on others. I, personally being a photographer, Instagram is a platform where I share my narration behind my lens to the world. But I always remind myself that my self-satisfaction comes when I lay my eyes on a beautiful landscape, when I balance its colors during post editing, not by getting likes after posting it on my page.</p>

        <p>Getting back to my friend’s story, luckily she did not commit suicide because she reached out to someone who could help her before taking her grave decision. Her account has been hacked by someone and the hacker has posted some sensitive content leading her account to get banned from the Instagram. She could not bear the fact that she lost her account with so much followers. But she was convinced otherwise, she has life out there, beyond it.

        <p>In conclusion, it is clear that, social media addiction and human psychology is inter-connected through a strong bridge. It is a bridge without a fence! Hence we should be careful to balance well while walking along it. If not, it can lead to serious issues like anxiety or even suicide. To cure this epidemic one should swallow two pills; ethics and psychological consistency. Also it is very important to lend a hand if someone loses the balance while crossing this bridge.
