        <p>Ever imagine what is it like to be surrounded by mountains? You do not have to
             keep imagining anymore, just hop on to a train and land your feet on Kandy! 
             Famously known as ‘Kanda Uda Rata’ in Sinhalese, this city of Sri Lanka is 
             simply a paradise for mountain lovers.</p>

            Protected by the layers of mountains and the serene lake of Kandy, this was once a Kingdom that was enriched with an interesting history. The Temple of Tooth Relic which is a famous tourist attraction carries the essence of this history and also serves as a symbol to this city.

            When you walk in the streets of Kandy you would see the green mountains kissing blue skies wherever you lay your eyes. To be more specific, these mountain tops are often covered with misty clouds making it hard to separate the skies from the mountain border.

        <header> Kandy is a romantic city </header>
        <p> The beautiful flowers that decorate the either side of streets, the city plan, architecture and especially the climate adds a romantic vibe to the city. It is beautiful how a busy city can be separated from a serene lake by a simple fence as seen in the photograph, placing two opposites side by side.

        <header>Even the sunrays are soothing in Kandy</header>
        <p>
            The scenario of the sun rising over the mountains is one of my favourite childhood drawings. Being able to capture that scenario being a photographer after growing up was such a satisfying experience for me. The sunrays of Kandy’s twilight filter through the dense clouds as if they are filtered through a beehive. Hence the rays are never too harsh on the blooming flowers

        <p>I personally, wait for my vacations to visit my grandparents in Kandy. Although I’m settled in Colombo, my heart always lies among those mountain ranges, which I’m emotionally bonded with. </p>

        <p>There’s this famous song called “Country roads” by John Denver. He explains how the “Blue ridge mountains” is “almost heaven” to him. And he is yearning for the “country roads” to take him home to the place he belongs. Whenever I listen to this song, I’m mentally traveling to my home, where the mountains surround me. </p>
